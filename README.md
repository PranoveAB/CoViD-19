# A Simple USSD Application To Spread Awareness on CoVID-19 Throughout India

As the deadly, fear-striking Novel Coronavirus (CoVID-19) continues to spread rapidly throughout India, most of the people are not aware of the severity of the situation, and hence have to be constantly made aware about the seriousness of the spread, by keeping them up to date with information such as the daily statistics, helpline numbers, symptoms of CoVID-19, how to stay safe, etc. This application ensures last-mile access to information to people, even at locations where facilities like television, internet, media are not available. People in India with any kind of mobile phone (be it a smartphone, feature phone, or even basic phone), can avail this service.

USSD is used for a wide range of purposes such as prepaid callback service, location-based content service, WAP browsing, mobile banking services, mobile chatting, and more.
